implementation_notes:
  - Filter strikes to ±10% of Expected Value before applying RSI strategy
  - Exclude bottom 5 performing tickers (identify from Section 13)
  - Apply Conservative RSI (14, 25/75) to filtered dataset
  - With $500 starting capital and 10% daily limit, expect to execute only a fraction of available trades
  - Position sizing simulation (Section 16) shows realistic returns with capital constraints
